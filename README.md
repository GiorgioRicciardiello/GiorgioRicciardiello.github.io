I believe science should serve people—helping us live healthier, longer, and more dignified lives. As a biomedical engineer and epidemiologist, I’ve focused my work on turning complex health data into tools that improve clinical decisions and public health outcomes. Whether translating time-series signals into actionable insights or building models from sleep questionnaires, I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and compassionate care.

My work blends machine learning, statistical reasoning, and a deep understanding of human physiology to advance diagnostic science. I’ve built multimodal models across 40k+ patient records, helped simplify diagnostics for sleep medicine, and contributed to international research efforts on Long COVID, neurodegeneration, and sleep phenotyping. I thrive at the intersection of rigor and curiosity—especially when the outcome drives better care for more people.
