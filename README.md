## Work Experience

### Stanford University – Mignot Laboratory  
**Research Assistant & Visiting Researcher (2021–Present)**  
- Analyzed extensive sleep disorder datasets to extract key patient characteristics and develop predictive models for REM Behavioral Disorder, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and Restless Legs Syndrome.  
- Developed deep learning classifiers using PSG data, enabling novel detection methods for sleep disorders.  
- Built algorithms to extract structured medical data from unstructured electronic health records of 40,000 digital records using vision transformers.  
- Collaborated on projects evaluating Long COVID’s impact on sleep biomarkers and neurophysiological metrics.  

### IMP Scandinavia, Denmark  
**Research Engineer – Signal Processing and AI (April 2023 – May 2023)**  
- Designed an end-to-end signal processing pipeline with filtering and feature extraction of PPG signals for the identification of clinically relevant cardiovascular measures for hospital care.  
- Collaborated with engineers and investors to identify the needs of the medical device while considering European standards and hardware limitations.  
- Designed and maintained documentation protocols to ensure compliance with medical device regulations such as ISO, MDR, and Design History Files.  

### Stanford University, California  
**Visiting Researcher – Mignot Laboratory (Sept. 2021 – March 2022)**  
- Implemented deep learning architectures for time series data to automatically diagnose sleep behavior disorders using PSGs, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and F1 scores.  
- Extracted valuable insights from explainable AI to better understand physiological patterns contributing to disorder severity.  
- Maintained and updated the Mignot Laboratory website using Flask and GitHub.
